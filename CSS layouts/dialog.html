        Elise "Lise" Meitner (/ˈliːzə ˈmaɪtnər/ LEE-zə MYTE-nər; German: [ˈliːzə ˈmaɪtnɐ] ⓘ; 7 November 1878 – 27
        October 1968), was an Austrian-Swedish nuclear physicist who was instrumental in the discovery of nuclear
        fission.

        Completing her doctoral research in 1906, Meitner became the second woman from the University of Vienna to
        earn a doctorate in physics. She spent much of her scientific career in Berlin, where she was a physics
        professor and a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. She was the first woman to
        become a full professor of physics in Germany. She lost her positions in 1935 because of the anti-Jewish
        Nuremberg Laws of Nazi Germany, and the 1938 Anschluss resulted in the loss of her Austrian citizenship. On
        13–14 July 1938, she fled to the Netherlands with the help of Dirk Coster. She lived in Stockholm for many
        years, ultimately becoming a Swedish citizen in 1949, but relocated to Britain in the 1950s to be with
        family members.
