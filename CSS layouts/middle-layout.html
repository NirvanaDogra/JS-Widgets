            Elise "Lise" Meitner (/ˈliːzə ˈmaɪtnər/ LEE-zə MYTE-nər; German: [ˈliːzə ˈmaɪtnɐ] ⓘ; 7 November 1878 – 27
            October 1968), was an Austrian-Swedish nuclear physicist who was instrumental in the discovery of nuclear
            fission.

            Completing her doctoral research in 1906, Meitner became the second woman from the University of Vienna to
            earn a doctorate in physics. She spent much of her scientific career in Berlin, where she was a physics
            professor and a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry. She was the first woman to
            become a full professor of physics in Germany. She lost her positions in 1935 because of the anti-Jewish
            Nuremberg Laws of Nazi Germany, and the 1938 Anschluss resulted in the loss of her Austrian citizenship. On
            13–14 July 1938, she fled to the Netherlands with the help of Dirk Coster. She lived in Stockholm for many
            years, ultimately becoming a Swedish citizen in 1949, but relocated to Britain in the 1950s to be with
            family members.

            In mid-1938, chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry
            demonstrated that isotopes of barium could be formed by neutron bombardment of uranium. Meitner was informed
            of their findings by Hahn, and in late December, with her nephew, fellow physicist Otto Robert Frisch, she
            worked out the physics of this process by correctly interpreting Hahn and Strassmann's experimental data. On
            13 January 1939, Frisch replicated the process Hahn and Strassmann had observed. In Meitner and Frisch's
            report in the February 1939 issue of Nature, they gave the process the name "fission". The discovery of
            nuclear fission led to the development of nuclear reactors and atomic bombs during World War II.

            Meitner did not share the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for nuclear fission, which was awarded to her
            long-time collaborator Otto Hahn. Several scientists and journalists have called her exclusion "unjust".
            According to the Nobel Prize archive, she was nominated 19 times for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry between
            1924 and 1948, and 30 times for the Nobel Prize in Physics between 1937 and 1967. Despite not having been
            awarded the Nobel Prize, Meitner was invited to attend the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting in 1962. She
            received many other honours, including the posthumous naming of element 109 meitnerium in 1997. Meitner was
            praised by Albert Einstein as the "German Marie Curie."[1]

            Early years
            Elise Meitner was born on 7 November 1878 into a Jewish upper-middle-class family at the family home in 27
            Kaiser Josefstraße in the Leopoldstadt district of Vienna, the third of eight children of chess master
            Philipp Meitner and his wife Hedwig. The birth register of Vienna's Jewish community lists her as being born
            on 17 November 1878, but all other documents list her date of birth as 7 November, which is what she
            used.[2] Her father was one of the first Jewish lawyers admitted to practice in Austria.[1] She had two
            older siblings, Gisela and Auguste (Gusti), and four younger: Moriz (Fritz), Carola (Lola), Frida and
            Walter; all ultimately pursued an advanced education.[3] Her father was a freethinker, and she was brought
            up as such.[1] As an adult, she converted to Christianity, following Lutheranism, and was baptised in
            1908;[4][5] her sisters Gisela and Lola converted to Catholicism that same year.[5] She also adopted the
            shortened name "Lise".[6]

            Education
            Meitner's interest in science began when she was eight, when she kept a notebook of her scientific research
            under her pillow. She was drawn to mathematics and science, and studied the colours of an oil slick, thin
            films, and reflected light. The only career available to women was teaching, so she attended a high school
            for girls where she trained as a French teacher. As well as French, her education included bookkeeping,
            arithmetic, history, geography, science and gymnastics. She completed high school in 1892. Women were not
            allowed to attend public institutions of higher education in Vienna until 1897, but when this restriction
            was lifted, the requirement for a gymnasium education was waived and women only needed to pass the matura,
            the secondary school leaving qualification required for university entrance. Her sister Gisela passed the
            matura and entered medical school in 1900. Meitner began taking private lessons with two other young women
            in 1899, cramming the missing years of secondary education in two. Physics was taught by Arthur Szarvasy. In
            July 1901, they sat an external matura examination at the Akademisches Gymnasium. Four out of the fourteen
            women passed, including Meitner and Henriette Boltzmann, the daughter of physicist Ludwig Boltzmann.[7][8]

            Research, work and academia
            University of Vienna

            Meitner in 1906
            Meitner entered the University of Vienna in October 1901.[9] She was particularly inspired by Ludwig
            Boltzmann and often spoke with enthusiasm about his lectures.[10] Her dissertation was supervised by Franz
            Exner and his assistant Hans Benndorf.[11] Her thesis, titled Prüfung einer Formel Maxwells ('Examination of
            a Maxwell Equation'), was submitted on 20 November 1905 and approved on 28 November. She passed an oral exam
            from Exner and Boltzmann on 19 December,[12] and was awarded her doctorate on 1 February 1906.[13] She
            became the second woman to earn a doctoral degree in physics at the University of Vienna, after Olga
            Steindler who had received her degree in 1903;[14] the third was Selma Freud, who worked in the same
            laboratory as Meitner, and received hers in 1906.[12] Meitner's thesis was published as Wärmeleitung in
            inhomogenen Körpern ('Thermal Conduction in Inhomogeneous Bodies') on 22 February 1906.[12][15]

            Paul Ehrenfest asked her to investigate an article on optics by Lord Rayleigh detailing an experiment that
            produced results Rayleigh had been unable to explain. She was able to explain the results, and also made
            predictions based on her explanation, which she then verified experimentally, demonstrating her ability to
            carry out independent and unsupervised research.[16] She published the results in her report on "Some
            Conclusions Derived from the Fresnel Reflection Formula".[17] In 1906, while engaged in this research,
            Meitner was introduced by Stefan Meyer to radioactivity, then a very new field of study. She started with
            alpha particles. In her experiments with collimators and metal foil, she found that scattering in a beam of
            alpha particles increased with the mass of the metal atoms. She submitted her findings to the Physikalische
            Zeitschrift on 29 June 1907. This was one of the experiments that led Ernest Rutherford to predict the
            nuclear atom.[16][18]

            Friedrich Wilhelm University

            Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn in 1912
            Encouraged and backed by her father's financial support, Meitner entered the Friedrich Wilhelm University in
            Berlin, where the renowned physicist Max Planck taught. Planck invited her to his home, and allowed her to
            attend his lectures. This was an unusual gesture by Planck, who was on record as opposing the admission of
            women to universities in general, but apparently recognised Meitner as an exception.[19] She became friends
            with Planck's twin daughters Emma and Grete, who were born in 1889, and shared Meitner's love of
            music.[20][21]

            Attending Planck's lectures did not take up all her time, and Meitner approached Heinrich Rubens, the head
            of the experimental physics institute, about doing some research. Rubens said that he would be happy for her
            to work in his laboratory. He also added that Otto Hahn at the chemistry institute was looking for a
            physicist to collaborate with. A few minutes later she was introduced to Hahn. He had studied radioactive
            substances under William Ramsay and Ernest Rutherford, and was already credited with the discovery of what
            were then thought to be several new radioactive elements.[22][23][a] Hahn was the same age as Meitner, and
            she noted his informal and approachable manner.[22][23] In Montreal, Hahn had become accustomed to
            collaboration with physicists—including at least one woman, Harriet Brooks.[25]


            Meitner and Hahn in their laboratory, in 1913. When a colleague she did not recognise said that they had met
            before, Meitner replied: "You probably mistake me for Professor Hahn."[26]
            The head of the chemistry institute, Emil Fischer, placed a former woodworking shop (Holzwerkstatt) at
            Hahn's disposal in the basement to use as a laboratory. Hahn equipped it with electroscopes to measure alpha
            and beta particles and gamma rays. It was not possible to conduct research in the wood shop, but Alfred
            Stock, the head of the inorganic chemistry department, let Hahn use a space in one of his two private
            laboratories.[27] Like Meitner, Hahn was unpaid, and lived off an allowance from his father, although
            somewhat larger than hers. He completed his habilitation in early 1907, and became a Privatdozent.[28] Most
            of the organic chemists at the chemistry institute did not regard Hahn's work—detecting minute traces of
            isotopes too small to see, weigh or smell through their radioactivity—as real chemistry.[23] One department
            head remarked that "it is incredible what one gets to be a Privatdozent these days!"[23] Lise Meitner helped
            discover the radioactive element protactinium .[29]

            The arrangement was difficult for Meitner at first. Women were not yet admitted to universities in the
            German state of the Kingdom of Prussia, which included Berlin. Meitner was allowed to work in the wood shop,
            which had its own external entrance, but she could not enter the rest of the institute, including Hahn's
            laboratory space upstairs. If she wanted to go to the toilet, she had to use one at the restaurant down the
            street. The following year, women were admitted to Prussian universities, and Fischer lifted the
            restrictions, and had women's toilets installed in the building. Not all the chemists were happy about
            this.[25] The Institute of Physics was more accepting, and she became friends with the physicists there,
            including Otto von Baeyer [de], James Franck, Gustav Hertz, Robert Pohl, Max Planck, Peter Pringsheim [de]
            and Wilhelm Westphal.[30]

            During the first years Meitner worked with Hahn, they co-authored nine papers: three in 1908 and six in
            1909. Together with Hahn, she discovered and developed a physical separation method known as radioactive
            recoil, in which a daughter nucleus is forcefully ejected as it recoils at the moment of decay. While Hahn
            was more concerned with discovering new elements (now known to be isotopes), Meitner was more interested in
            understanding their radiation. She observed that radioactive recoil, which had been discovered by Harriet
            Brooks in 1904, could be a new way of detecting radioactive substances. They soon discovered two more new
            isotopes, bismuth-211 and thallium-207.[31][32][33] Meitner was particularly interested in beta particles.
            By this time, they were known to be electrons. Alpha particles were emitted with characteristic energy, and
            she expected that this would be true of beta particles too. Hahn and Meitner carefully measured the
            absorption of beta particles by aluminium, but the results were puzzling. In 1914, James Chadwick found that
            electrons emitted from the nucleus formed a continuous spectrum, but Meitner found this hard to believe, as
            it seemed to contradict quantum physics, which held that electrons in an atom can only occupy discrete
            energy states (quanta).[
